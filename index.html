	<p class="intro"> Introducing BioRhyme, a versatile Latin typeface with a modern twist on classic design. Originally offered in two distinct widths, BioRhyme has recently undergone a transformation, now available as a unified variable font family. This means you have access to a spectrum of weights, from airy ExtraLight to bold ExtraBold, all while maintaining a consistent style.</p>

	<p class="intro"> Whether you're seeking a nostalgic vibe or a touch of contemporary edge, BioRhyme offers the flexibility to suit your needs. Its expanded width option adds a touch of personality to display text, while the normal width provides a clean and balanced look for body copy.</p>

One approach is marked up all within a p tag ("alphabet_chunk"). The second option below is marked up as an unordered list with list items ("alphabet_tiles"); this one will be friendly to using CSS grid for its layout. -->

			<h3> Set beautiful body copy with BioRhyme</h3>
			
			<div id="body_copy_paragraphs">
			<p id="body_copy1"> <span class="first_word1">One of the characters I met,</span> the Poet O, trundled around <span class="body_copy_bold">Central Park</span> with a shopping cart. He had a bushy white beard and he would ring a handbell. If you gave him money, he thanked you by reciting a poem that he composed on the spot, a sort of blank verse. He made promises to cure paying listeners of sexual diseases by ringing his bell. I talked with him often, and once he realized that I didn’t have the means to pay him for his wisdom, he dispensed it for free. Among other things, he explained to me the value of <span class="body_copy_bold">Central Park </span> as a large, outdoor sanitorium. He said he was mentally ill, and the park enabled him to get out of his single room in a <span class="body_copy_bold">West Side hotel</span> and be out in nature— not elbow to elbow with people— where he could experience what he called <span class="body_copy_italics">“the natural medication of nature.”</span> The park, he explained, was saving the government huge amounts of money by allowing mentally ill people to <span class="body_copy_italics">“self- medicate”</span> through the intoxicants of the romantic landscape and avoid expensive mental hospitals and drugs. </p>		
			
				<p id="body_copy2"> <span class="first_letter1">W</span>hen we refer to the <span class="body_copy_italics">“bad old days”</span> of <span class="body_copy_bold">Central Park</span>, we are usually talking about the days of rampant crime, graffiti, abandoned buildings, bare lawns, and dead trees. And yet I miss some aspects of those old days. In particular, Central Park was home to a lot of <span class="body_copy_italics">“characters”</span> who added to the atmosphere, but who, for the most part, are not there anymore. </p>		

				<p id="body_copy3"> <span class="first_letter2">A</span>nother character, a flamboyant man with a pompadour, toured the park on an elaborate bicycle, pulling a tricycle with a red wagon behind it. A series of enormous tropical birds, cockatoos and parrots, rode on the tricycle and wagon behind him as he circled the park, allowing people to admire his birds. Perhaps the best known was <span class="body_copy_bold">Adam Purple</span>, with his long flowing white beard and purple, tie- dyed clothes, who traveled the park on his purple bicycle picking up horse manure to compost in his garden on the <span class="body_copy_bold">Lower East Side</span>. For a while, a woman in purple, whom he called Eve, accompanied him. </p>
			
			<p id="body_copy4"> <span class="first_word2">These were some of the Central Park characters.</span> Today, they are not nearly as numerous. <span class="body_copy_bold">The Central Park Conservancy</span> and <span class="body_copy_bold">New York City </span>have invested six hundred million dollars in private and public funds to restore the glory of the nineteenth- century landscape in a way that suits twenty- first- century users. Ladies in hoop skirts and gentlemen in linen suits strolling along the paths have given way to both genders running and cycling in <span class="body_copy_bold">Lycra</span> tops and bottoms that their predecessors would have seen as underwear. Or perhaps you simply cannot see the characters now that almost forty million visitors enter the park each year. I suppose it is better that the park is busier than ever rather than abandoned, which it essentially was back in the seventies. Maybe now you just have to look a little closer to find the characters. </p>

<!-- TIPS and NOTES FOR WORKING WITH HTML FILES, BELOW --> 

<!-- TIP 1: HTML files are for CONTENT and our CSS files are for PRESENTATION. Separating them is important for organization. -->

<!-- TIP 2: Remember, most elements have an opening AND closing tag with content between them. Ex: <h1>Title Text</h1> -->

<!-- TIP 3: Use the tab key, vs spaces, to organize your content. -->

<!-- TIP 4: Know that space is hard to control and is not visible within the html. The best starting point is using margin and padding settings in the correlating CSS, and preview often in the browser. -->

<!-- NOTE: The body tag contains all content that will be visible inside a browser window on someone's device. -->

<!-- NOTE: The header element is where we normally place our navigation and other repeated elements across all of our pages. Usually these elements are at the top of the page, but can go elsewhere. -->

<!-- NOTE: The nav element is where the navigation code would normally go. Notice it is nested inside of the header element. -->

<!-- NOTE: divs and block-level elements are the basic building blocks of HTML/CSS. Use them to separate (“chunkify”) content for CSS stlying. -->
